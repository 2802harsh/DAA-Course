### Theory
Divide and Conquer is an approach which recursively breaks down a problem at hand into two or more sub-problems until they canâ€™t be broken down further or they become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to these sub-problems are then combined to give the solution for the original problem.
Consider an array A, and two indices _i_ and _j_, such that _i_ < _j_ and __A[i]__ > __A[j]__. This is called an inversion in the array. Thus, the Inversion Count of an array is the count of all the pairs _(i,j)_ such that _i_ < _j_ and __A[i]__ > __A[j]__
